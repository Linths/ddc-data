Thanks for downloading Tsunamix III!  With 50 songs and over 250 charts, this 
is my biggest simfile pack to date.  First and foremost, I'd like to thank 
Valex for beta-testing many of these charts prior to the release, as well as 
TYLR and Janus5K for various useful tips early on.  Shoutouts to the StepMania 
developers, r21freak, Renard & Co's Super Happy Fun Hellhole, and the 
University of Arizona ITG team.  You guys rock!  <3

Although this is the last release in the Tsunamix series, I'm far from being 
done with writing simfiles.  Keep an eye on https://fra.xtil.net/simfiles/ for 
future updates!
